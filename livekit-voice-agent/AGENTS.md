## LiveKit Documentation

LiveKit Agents is a fast-evolving project, and the documentation is updated frequently. You should always refer to the latest documentation when working with this project. For your convenience, LiveKit offers an MCP server that can be used to browse and search its documentation. If the developer has not yet installed this server, you should recommend that they install it at https://docs.livekit.io/mcp.

### Agent Instructions
- Use the `livekit-docs` MCP server for any questions regarding LiveKit SDKs, architecture, or features.
- If the server is offline, use https://docs.livekit.io/llms.txt as a fallback.
- Prioritize concise, modular code examples following the patterns in the official docs.
